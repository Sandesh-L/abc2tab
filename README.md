The project is used to generate guitar tab music from music in ABC notation.
Usage:
- Look at the individual folders for each package (downward, Tabctoabc, abctab2ps) and make sure you have the required packages/libraries.
- For default use: Run the `get_tab.sh` file with the location of the `.abc` file you want to convert.
    - example use: `source get_tab.sh ../abcMusic/forTesting/ladyAndFarmer.abc`
    - `../` the abc file is used by a program in a different folder 
    - `get_tab.sh` attempts to recreate 
- If you want to use a different algorithm to decide note location then change the `--search` criteria in the `get_tab.sh` file  
    - use `cea`, or `lmcut` heuristics. `cea` is faster but `lmcut` is better
    - visit the fast-downward website for other search algorithms
